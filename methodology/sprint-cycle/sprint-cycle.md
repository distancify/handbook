# Sprint Cycle

## Sprint

A sprint is a timeboxed set of time. Each sprint should be exactly the same amount of calendar days. Planned vacation and national holidays should be taken into account when mapping out upcoming sprints to make sure forecasts are as accurate as possible. However, there will always be unforseen events that occur and limits our resources, such as sick days and other emergencies. These are expected to be averaged out over time and should not be taken into account when planning sprints.

A sprint is never extended beyond it's original end date. Whatever work has not been done by the end of the sprint should be taken as a sign that the estimation was off and that we need to plan according to the new information we now have.

These events may decrease the commitment in a sprint:

- Planned vacation or similar reasons we might lack people, such as planned parental leave or a long term sick leave
- National holidays
- Team building events

## Sprint Commitment

Before a new sprint starts, the Client Sponsor and Product Owner will communicate to the team the amount of work that the Client is ready to purchase for the next sprint. In a utopian world, the Client would want to go as far as possible as soon as possible and so would ask the team to commit to whatever it possibly could. In a real world though, there are budgets, deadlines and marketing on the Client's side that sometimes leads to a lower effort.

Once the level of effort has been established the team will pull the items from the top of the current backlog that they gauge as committable. Should the team not have enough available resources for the upcoming Sprint, the Client's requested effort should be regarded as a suggested maximum effort but make a smaller commitment.

Sometimes, there are technical reasons why the order of the backlog can't be implemented in the suggested order. In this case, the team is free to pick items further down the backlog and present the reasons for this during the [Sprint Review](#sprint-review).

It is the team that ultimately makes the commitment and delivers it to the Client and Product Owner. From the start of the sprint to the end of it, the team has full ownership of delivering on the needs specified in the items in the sprint.

## Sprint Planning

...

## Sprint Summary

At the end of each sprint, the team compiles a sprint summary. This summary should be in written form and distributed to the customer and product owner, often as part of the [Sprint Review](sprint-review) meeting.

The sprint summary should contain the following:

- A short story (1-2 paragraphs) that summarises the overall theme of the sprint. What was the focus and how the work progressed
- A list of the PBIs that was committed to
- A list of which PBIs has been delivered
- A list if things that was done, PBIs or otherwise, that was not specified in the commitment but was done anyway

## Rituals

### Sprint Review

A sprint review is where the team sits down together with stakeholders and product owner and shows the result of what has actually been done. Some features will be more visual in it's nature and will always be easier to show. But remember that if a PBI solves a problem for someone, there should always be a way of proving or showing that the system now solves it.

The meeting can be either physical or remote (in our case often remote). The important thing is that all the necessary stakeholders and representatives from the team is available.

The meeting should be held within the last two days of the sprint ends to avoid interfering with the next sprint. Since committing to the next sprint is part of what is done in the Sprint Review no work on the next sprint can begin before the meeting is held, since this meeting is where the commitment for next sprint is done.

Since the team may be working on multiple projects in parallel in the sprint, and each project require a Sprint Review, the meetings must be concise and efficient so that they can be held within the last 2 days of the sprint.

The team is expected to have prepared the written [Sprint Summary](sprint-summary) before the meeting.

The timebox for the meeting is 1 hour, and it should be recorded.

The agenda for a sprint review is as follows:

- The team presents the sprint summary (and hand it over to the receivers)
- The team demos the features, which is **done** (fulfill definition of done)
- The product owner is asked to accept the result of the sprint, meaning that the team has done everything within it's means to deliver on the requirements specified in the committed PBIs
- The Product Owner will present (the top of) the backlog to everybody in the Sprint Review together with the desired sprint involvement (budget) from the Client Sponsor, and based on this the team decides which PBIs they will commit to in the upcoming sprint

For the sprint review to be considered valid should the following roles be present:

* Mandatory: Product owner, Client sponsor and Team captain.

* Highly recommended: Team coach, (all) members of the team and key stakeholders in the Client's organization

### Stand Up

Every day, the team needs to have a status update. This is to get everyone up to date on how the current sprint is progressing. The team captain is the moderator of the meeting.

The meeting is tactical in it's nature. The timebox for the meeting is **15 minutes**. This can not be extended and it's the moderators job to make sure it's not.

The agenda for a stand up is as follows:

- Everyone reports on what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today and whether they think they will need any support from someone else with any specific PBI. There should be **no** discussion around what or how the work will get done. The stand up is not a design meeting. If a person states that they need help, that is noted down by the moderator.
- The moderator looks at the burn down chart to gauge whether there might be a concern for the sprint. If anyone stated that they need help or the burndown chart is starting to diverge, the team must quickly determine what the problem is and make a decision about which members of the team will scramble to solve the problem. Note that the stand up is **not** a place to be discussing what needs to be done, but rather assign who will handle the problem.

#### Stand Up Meeting Minutes

Should be written by the moderator. Should be short and simple and only contain exceptional information. Should not contain what people have done or what they plan to do. This information should be available within the project management tool by task assignment etc. But any issue that has been raised must be noted down and the assigned members that is tasked with solving the problem. This information is critical when it comes to compiling the Sprint Summary at the end of the sprint.
