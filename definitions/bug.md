# Bug

We don't estimate bugs.

Bugs are mistakes created by us (or other 3rd party developers). Through our 6 month warranty we take full responsibility of our own mistakes, and always try to reserve time to fix any other bugs. We try to keep bugs to a minimum but they are ultimately inevitable.

For this to work, we need to have a clear definition of what a bug is.

### A bug is something that:

- Prevents the user from accomplishing the task that the system is designed to perform or
- Prevents the system to fulfill the need that the system was designed to fulfill
- For warranty: Is any of the above and can be tied to a previous change made by the team as part of a "point-cost feature" within the last 6 month from date of report

### A bug is not

- Something that can be improved
- A behavior that is unexpected from the user's perspective. Because expectations are subjective and there are billions of people with different expectations. This is merely a matter of quality. A high quality system meets the expectations of most of it's users.
