# Internal Communication

## Text Based Communications

Internally we avoid e-mail as much as we can. The reason for this is because e-mail threads have a tendency to branch out and disconnect. E-mail also doesn't provide the necessary transparency within the team.

Instead we use Twist threads to discuss various topics asyncronously.

For syncronous text based communication, we use Twist chat. Twist chat should be used only for work. There's a WhatsApp group for social hangout and other ramblings for those who are interested.

## Video Based Communication

For video, we exclusively use [Appear.in](https://appear.in/).

Make sure you have a proper hardware setup. You will always be at a disadvantage if you have sound issues or other problems and it will severely impact the effectiveness of meetings.

Here are some tips to make sure you have effective video meetings:

- Have an agenda. Know what you want to get out of the meeting or conversation before it starts.
- Use a good webcam ([Logitech C930](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c930e-webcam) is a good pick), on the centered on the top of your primary screen. This is extremely imporant as people will have a hard time keeping a conversation with someone that is always looking away from them.
- If you have to be in a room with other people, make sure you use a headset. The [Plantronics Savi](https://www.plantronics.com/gb/en/product/savi-8200?skuId=W8220) range is probably the best money can buy.
- If you're alone in your room, you might want to opt out of using a headset since a headset can be straining on your ears in long meetings. You also look more natural without a headset and the meeting will feel less like a phone call. **But**, if you don't have a headset, make sure your acoustics are good.

### How to get good acoustics when not using a headset

- Use a good directional mic. The Logitech C930 comes with a pretty good mic.
- Do not use the built in speaker in your monitor if you use your webcam as a mic. The sound from the monitor will travel through the material and into the webcam.
- Make sure you have some sound dampening materials in the room, such as a floor carpet and curtains.
- Test your sound and mic before the meeting starts. Make sure you don't have any feedback loop or echo where sound from your speakers can reach your mic.

### Sound discipline aka mute your mic

When there's more than 3 people in a meeting, you should get into the habit of always muting yourself when you're not talking. The reason is that the more people you get into a video meeting, the more unintended noise is going to occur. Someone coughing or unintentionally scratching their microphone adds up to an overall noisy environment. One reason why this happens in video meetings is because of the technology. All sound is equal in a video meeting. You can't direct your focus toward the person talking because. If everyone is having a headset on, it's like having 3+ people talking a few centimeters from your ears.

## Favor Text Over Talk

We all live in various time zones and squeezing everybody into syncronous meetings can be extremely time consuming. First of all, everybody in the meeting needs to adjust their schedule to be there on time. This will always be wasteful as most people will not be able to go into any deep work for about 30 minutes before and after the meeting.

Secondly, physical or video meetings leave a lot fewer traces than text based conversations. Sometimes it's necessary to go back and figure out why certain decisions where made. Unless you have very detailed meeting minutes, this is going to be difficult if all decisions where made in meetings.
