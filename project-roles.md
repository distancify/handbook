# Project Roles

Each project has a couple of key roles that interact with the client and team in certain ways.

## Product Owner

At Distancify, the Product Owner in a project is almost always a Distancify employee, acting as a customer proxy. The reason for this is that the key value of working with Distancify is that we have vast experience from our industry, mainly digital commerce. Often more so that the client itself. On top of that, we can make sure our Product Owners are highly skilled problem solvers and technical thinkers that knows how to bring a system from A to Z.

The Product Owner owns the project backlog. This means nothing goes into the backlog without the hand of the Product Owner. The Product Owner's responsibility is to make sure that we are building the right thing that brings the most business value to the client. Since the backlog is the foundation for the project's planning, the Product Owner roles also include classical project management roles such as keeping track of overall progress and long-term planning.

In order to be an effective Product Owner, you have to have authority from the client. This is often something that is built with trust over time. But to make things more practical, the Product Owner cooperates with a business representative from the client's organization. We call this person [Client Sponsor](#client-sponsor).

## Client Sponsor

The Client Sponsor is a representative from the client, often in a senior or leadership position. This person is ultimately accountable for the business case of the project towards it's own organization. The Client Sponsor is the person that delegates authority to the Product Owner in order for the Product Owner to work effectively. The Client Sponsor has "veto" rights, meaning it has the full authority to at any point pause or cancel the project if it's not going in the right direction. This is a safety mechanism handed over from Distancify to the client which is rarely used.

The Client Sponsor works very close to the [Product Owner](#product-owner) to gauge the business value of all the requirements that the team delivers on. This makes sure that the project focuses on the most important tasks first.

## Team Coach

We believe that any evolving team require a coach. In our Scrum teams, the Team Coach also serves as a Scrum Master in the traditional sense.

The Team Coach:

- Coaches the members of the teams, helping new members find their role etc.
- Helps identifying impediments and help solving them
- Makes sure the team follow our processes, such as making sure members show up for daily, retro etc.
- Makes sure the team meetings are effective and to the point, such as the daily stand-up
- Help the team focus on what's important and keep the long term productivity high
- Is not focusing on coding, at least not in the team's sprint, but could be solving the teams impediments using code
- Is not held accountable for the team's work, but is held accountable for **how the team work**

## Team Leader

If each sprint was a battlefield, the Team Leader is the person that leads the team to victory.

The Team Leader:

- Is a Team Member
- Should be the natural leader of the team, and is often but not always the most senior person in the team 
- Makes sure that the Team Members achieve growth and execute at the peak of their ability
- Points out the direction and priorities in the sprint

## Team Member

Team Members can serve various roles depending on their unique skillset within the team and the project at hand. Some members are programmers, others are architects and others are UX designers. Each team should strive to have a wide area of competence by having members of different disciplines. A Team Member should also focus on developing a "T-shaped" competence, where you have decent knowledge in all areas but specialized in at least one or more areas.
