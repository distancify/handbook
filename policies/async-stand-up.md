# Async Stand-up

While the stand-up is a video-based real-time meeting every morning, it focuses mainly on the day ahead. To avoid spending time going through what happened yesterday, which may or may not be interesting for the whole team, we make a post about what progress we have made and issues has arised during the day.

This is supposed to be done before going home, but any time up until around 06:00 the morning after is fine.

The report should be put into [Jell](https://jell.com/)
