# Calendar, Vacation and Leave

## Calendar Sharing

Always make sure your collegues can access and look at your calendar. This will make it easier to schedule meetings but also figure out where you are if you happen to not be around. Since we are a distributed company we don't see each other. But your calendar tells us where you are.

This of course means that you need to keep your calendar up to date. If you're going out of office, even if it's a personal errand, block out the time in your calendar.

In order to give your collegues access to see your calendar, [follow this guide](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-an-outlook-calendar-with-other-people-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88). If you feel your integrity being invaded, it's fine to only give your collegues the right to see title and locations.

## Vacation and Leave

We have 6 weeks paid vacation. If you want to use it (and you really should), talk to your team to figure out when would be the best time. As a team, you are responsible for delivering your commitments so take that into account whenever planning vacation.

The same principle goes for any other type of leave. Various laws apply here for different countries but in general the team can not deny your leave. If you're in doubt, contact Kristoffer or Johan. Planning your leave well in advance is very much recommended. Especially if you hope to have your team mates return the favor.
