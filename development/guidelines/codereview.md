# Code review and pull request

At Distancify are code review (as part of pull request) an integrated part of the daily life of a developer.

The main purpose of our code reviews is to do findings which can't be caught by automated tools.

Stuff we are looking for in out code review is:

- Is the code covered with unit tests? "This requires a unit test"
- Is the code clear and readable? Naming and semantics, both the reviewer and developer should be able to read the code
- Do we follow our [coding conventions](coding-conventions.md)? Not all parts can be found by a linting tool

The code review should not the the main source of knowledge sharing, for this is pair programming a much better exercise.
