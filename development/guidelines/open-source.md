# Open Source

## Source Control

We use GitHub for all open source efforts. At GitHub, there's an organization called "distancify". Ask any of the current members to gain access.

## Continuous Integration

For our public open source efforts, we use AppVeyor for building our code. Ask Kristoffer to get an invite to the account.

## Licensing

Different projects may use different licensing depending on the type of project, but when in doubt, use the following licenses when publishing new projects:

- For **Libraries**: LGPL v3
- For **Applications**: GPL v3
