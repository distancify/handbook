# Introduction

Distancify's software development methodology is made to stimulate quality, knowledge sharing, high efficiency and transparency for stakeholders. The underlying methodology is based on Scrum, but is not Scrum. If you have been exposed to Scrum in the past, you will certainly recognize parts of it. Due to us being an external partner of our customers and the fact that we tie our compensation to deliverables, some changes has been made to simplify and structure the way we work.

Distancify's methodology doesn't have any catchy name, and is constantly evolving to meet new needs.
