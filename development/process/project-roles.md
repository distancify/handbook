# Project Roles

Each project has a couple of key roles that interact with the client and team in certain ways. At Distancify, we don't believe in Job Titles. People act in various roles depending on the context and we are always improving and evaluating ourselves. Therefor, your employment contract doesn't necessarily specify a role, and your wage is not connected to it either.

## Product Owner

At Distancify, the Product Owner in a project is almost always a Distancify employee, acting as a customer proxy. The reason for this is that the key value of working with Distancify is that we have vast experience from our industry, mainly digital commerce. Often more so that the client itself. On top of that, we can make sure our Product Owners are highly skilled problem solvers and technical thinkers that knows how to bring a system from A to Z.

The Product Owner owns the project backlog. This means nothing goes into the backlog without the hand of the Product Owner. The Product Owner's responsibility is to make sure that we are building the right thing that brings the most business value to the client. Since the backlog is the foundation for the project's planning, the Product Owner roles also include classical project management roles such as keeping track of overall progress and long-term planning.

In order to be an effective Product Owner, you have to have authority from the client. This is often something that is built with trust over time. But to make things more practical, the Product Owner cooperates with a business representative from the client's organization. We call this person [Client Sponsor](#client-sponsor).

## Client Sponsor

The Client Sponsor is a representative from the client, often in a senior or leadership position. This person is ultimately accountable for the business case of the project towards it's own organization. The Client Sponsor is the person that delegates authority to the Product Owner in order for the Product Owner to work effectively. The Client Sponsor has "veto" rights, meaning it has the full authority to at any point pause or cancel the project if it's not going in the right direction. This is a safety mechanism handed over from Distancify to the client which is rarely used.

The Client Sponsor works very close to the [Product Owner](#product-owner) to gauge the business value of all the requirements that the team delivers on. This makes sure that the project focuses on the most important tasks first.

## Team Roles

## Coach

We believe that any evolving team require a coach. In our Scrum teams, the Coach also serves as a Scrum Master in the traditional sense.

The Coach:

- Coaches the members of the teams, helping new members find their role etc.
- Helps identifying impediments and help solving them
- Makes sure the team follow our processes, such as making sure members show up for daily, retro etc.
- Makes sure the team meetings are effective and to the point, such as the daily stand-up
- Help the team focus on what's important and keep the long term productivity high
- Is not focusing on coding, at least not in the team's sprint, but could be solving the teams impediments using code
- Is not held accountable for the team's work, but is held accountable for **how the team work**
- Makes sure that Team Members achieve growth and execute at the peak of their ability

## Captain

If each sprint was a battlefield, the Captain is the person that leads the team to victory. The Captain points out the direction and priorities in the sprint and is therefor the most critical component in [Sprint Planning](sprint-cycle.md#sprint-planning). The person acting as a Captain should be the natural leader of the team, and is often but not always the most senior person.

As a Captain, you must be able to take a step back from front line in order to lead your whole team. It's a balancing act. Not too far ahead, doing all the development yourself. Not too far back, only reviewing code and managing process and plans. The Captain needs to be in the middle, applying effort where it is most needed. Such as helping junior developers or focusing on the most critical or difficult problems.

In the event that the Captain is not available, for example in the case of sick leave, the team must assign a new temporary Captain until the regular one is back.

## Member

Team Members can serve various roles depending on their unique skillset within the team and the project at hand. Some members are programmers, others are architects and others are UX designers. Each team should strive to have a wide area of competence by having members of different disciplines. A Team Member should also focus on developing a "T-shaped" competence, where you have decent knowledge in all areas but specialized in at least one or more areas.
