# Bugs

## Definition

We will never estimate bugs. Bugs are mistakes generated by us and we take full responsibility for our mistakes. Therefor Bugs should slow us down. They should lower the velocity. We must work harder to keep our pace if we introduce bugs.

For this to work, we need to have a clear definition of what a bug is.

### A bug is something that is:

- Prevents the user from accomplishing the task that the system is designed to perform or
- Prevents the system to fulfill the need that the system was designed to fulfill
- Can be tied to a previous change made by the team

### A bug is not (unless it's also anything of the above):

- Something that can be improved
- A behavior that is unexpected from the user's perspective. Because expectations are subjective and there are billions of people with different expectations. This is merely a matter of quality. A high quality system meets the expectations of most of it's users.
