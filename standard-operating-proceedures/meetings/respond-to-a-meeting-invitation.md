# Respond to a Meeting Invitation

Before responding to a meeting invitation, ask yourself the following question:

- Does the meeting have a clear agenda?
- Is the meeting about a domain of which I have a considerable insight?
- Is the meeting of appropriate length?
- Do I have time?

If you answer no to any of the questions above, it's your duty to decline the meeting invitation. When declining a meeting invitation, always make sure to provide a valid reason for your rejection
