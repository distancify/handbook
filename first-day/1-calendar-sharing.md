# Calendar Sharing

Always make sure your collegues can access and look at your calendar. This will make it easier to schedule meetings but also figure out where you are if you happen to not be around. Since we are a distributed company we don't see each other. But your calendar tells us where you are.

If you feel your integrity being invaded, it's fine to only give your collegues the right to see title and locations.
