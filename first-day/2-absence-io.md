# Absence.io

We use Absence.io to manage all vacation and leave. After you receive your invitation via e-mail, log in and access your **Profile > Integrations** and enable Office 365 integration. This will automatically put any planned leave in Absence in your Outlook calendar, so your colleagues can see when you're available when scheduling meetings.

Note that the data in Absence.io is also used to calculate your pay, so make sure it's up-to-date.
