# Documentation

Documentation is not a work artifact. It's meta information. Information about work. Explaining the result and how we got there. And where we are heading.

The below chart shows the various types of documentation that we keep in our core business. Outside of this there are financial documentation, HR documentation etc. 

The chart does not display how and where work is stored. It does however mention source code, but that is source code in the context of describing work. As we want self-describing code as much as possible. As a team member, you are free to keep your work in progress anywhere you want. For example on your whiteboard, on a piece of paper or in Dropbox. The storage of artifacts is a subject for another article.
