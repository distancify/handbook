# Vacation and Leave

## Vacation and Leave

We have 6 weeks paid vacation. If you want to use it (and you really should), talk to your team to figure out when would be the best time. As a team, you are responsible for delivering your commitments so take that into account whenever planning vacation. The Team Captain is ultimately responsible for vacation planning, and should collaborate with the team to find the optimal solution. 

The same principle goes for any other type of leave. Various laws apply here for different countries but in general the team can not deny your leave. If you're in doubt, contact Kristoffer or Johan. Planning your leave well in advance is very much recommended. Especially if you hope to have your team mates return the favor.
