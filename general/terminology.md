# Terminology

When working at Distancify, you are going to run into all kinds of domain specific terminology and abbreviations. You will also find a lot of these terms used throughout the Handbook, so here's an attempt to gather some of the more common ones we use internally.

*Note to editors: Try to keep the list in alphabetical order :-)*

- **Client Sponsor**\
See [Project Roles / Client Sponsor](../development/process/project-roles.md#client-sponsor).
- **Product Backlog Item (PBI)**\
See [Product Backlog / Product Backlog Item (PBI)](../development/process/product-backlog.md#product-backlog-item-pbi).
- **Product Owner**\
See [Project Roles / Product Owner](../development/process/project-roles.md#product-owner).
- **Scrum Master**\
Can be used interchangebly with *Team Coach* in Scrum teams. See [Project Roles / Team Coach](../development/process/project-roles.md#team-coach) for more details.
- **Sprint**\
In speech and in writing, we prefer to use the word sprint over *Iteration*. Although *Iteration* is synonymous with the word *Sprint* and can be used interchangebly, we usually say *Sprint*. Some of our internal systems use the word *Iteration*, in which case it means *Sprint*.
- **Team Coach**\
Can be used interchangebly with *Scrum Master* in Scrum teams. See [Project Roles / Team Coach](../development/process/project-roles.md#team-coach) for more details.
- **Velocity**\
The Velocity is the amount of Story Points on average completed within a sprint by the team.
