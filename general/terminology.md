# Terminology

When working at Distancify, you are going to run into all kinds of domain specific terminology and abbreviations. Here's an attempt to gather some of the more common ones we use internally.

- **Client Sponsor**\
See [Project Roles / Client Sponsor](../development/process/project-roles.md#client-sponsor).
- **Product Backlog Item (PBI)**\
We use the term Product Backlog Item (or PBI, yes we actually refers to it as "PBI" in speech) to refer to an item in a backlog. PBI is a slightly more general term than the sometimes more specific industry-standard terms *User Story* or *Requirement*. A PBI can be a user story, or it could be a requirement. It depends more on how it's formulated.
- **Product Owner**\
See [Project Roles / Product Owner](../development/process/project-roles.md#product-owner).
- **Scrum Master**\
Can be used interchangebly with *Team Coach* in Scrum teams. See [Project Roles / Team Coach](../development/process/project-roles.md#team-coach) for more details.
- **Sprint**\
In speech and in writing, we prefer to use the word sprint over *Iteration*. Although *Iteration* is synonymous with the word *Sprint* and can be used interchangebly, we usually say *Sprint*. Some of our internal systems use the word *Iteration*, in which case it means *Sprint.
- **Team Coach**\
Can be used interchangebly with *Scrum Master* in Scrum teams. See [Project Roles / Team Coach](../development/process/project-roles.md#team-coach) for more details.
