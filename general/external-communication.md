# External Communication

## E-mail

The primary ways of communicating with externally is through e-mail. Be sure to use a signature so that people know who you are and how to contact you. It should include:

- Your name
- Current role
- E-mail
- Phone number
- Distancify Logotype
- Link to Distancify.com
- Company address

## Video

Another effective means of communicating with external parties is through video meetings. Feel free to invite people into anyone of our appear.in rooms. Even non-technical people seem to find it very easy to use.

Be sure to always do meeting minutes or record the meeting so that everyone agree on what has been decided. This is especially important when working with external parties.
