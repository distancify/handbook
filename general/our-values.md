# Our Values

Distancify is a value-driven company. This means that instead of hiring a PR firm to make a pretty powerpoint with some powerful words, our values actually mean something. Kristoffer and Johan originally started Distancify because they saw that the IT business where broken. Too many vendors got away with too much. An overheated economy and a hype-driven e-commerce industry was the perfect storm to create companies out of thin air that charged hefty hourly fees but not delivering any actual value.

As we set out to fix this, we realized that we need a rule of measure that goes beyond classic economic KPIs such as revenue and profit. We need value that guides us and make us take the right decision in the face of short term pain and chaos.

## Long Term

Means that we play the long game. We are fine with taking short term pain in order to move toward the real goal. This goes both for outselves and for our customers. We will not take shortcuts to deliver short term value if that means sacrificing our ability to keep deliver value in the long run.

Examples of behavior that this leads to:

- We avoid over-promising to the best of our ability
- We value a sensible work-life balance and do not rely on people working day, night and weekends to finish projects
- We don't do what the customer say they want, but we focus on what they need

## Care

We have a general sense of caring for everything around us. We care about ourselves, our collegues and their families. We care about our customers and the service we provide them. We care about our partners and the industry we work in.

Examples of behavior that this leads to:

- We are good at listening
- We help each other
- We have a value based price model instead of cost based

## Honesty

Sometimes the biggest lie is the thing you're not saying at all. Honesty is as much about not telling lies, as it is saying it like it is. We are honest to ourselves, our collegues and our customers. We don't do things that we can't be honest about.

Examples of behaviour that this leads to:

- We differ on the subject and person
- We play on the best foot
- We are transparent with what is happening in the company among ourselves and toward our customers
- We take ownership and don't blame others
- We value progress over work, because reporting how much time you spent at work and hiding what progress has been made is dishonest
