# Meetings policy

Meetings are an unavoidable part of everyday work at Distancify, some meetings are just two persons and some meetings are the whole company.
Everybody at the company are fully booked and therefor we should be careful when using each others time.

In general, if the meeting does not allow for any interaction could it just as well be a recording.

## Planning the meeting

- Consider the type [meeting and facilitation](meetings-definitions.md)
- Consider if the meeting might have an alternative (is the meeting really needed)
- Prepare agenda (need by invited attendees to know if they need to attend)
- Prepare content
- Decide on the venue / location
- Virtual or online facilitation, decide which tools to be used (and inform in the agenda)
- Consider the physical frame like address, location and surroundings
- Do shorter Meetings, do meetings less Often

A ground rule is that 80% of meetings should be no more than 15 minutes long, meetings har a tendency to take the alocated time (rarely less)
