# The Stand-up

The Stand-up is an everyday morning meeting where the team goes through the daily plan for each member.

The goal is to make sure work load is evenly distributed and to handle derailing plans and meet deadlines. It's also a good place to highlight if you're struggling with something and need help. Or are blocked by something outside of your control.

The Stand-up is not a place to walk through what happened yesterday. For that, we have the [Async Stand-up Policy](../../policies/async-stand-up.md).
