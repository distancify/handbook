# Facilitate a meeting

The meetings mentioned within this article are referring to synchronous meetings, where everybody is engaged in real-time. While an e-mail thread or a discussion on Yammer can technically be regarded as a virtual meeting, they require a much less formal approach.

## Planning the meeting

- Consider the [type of meeting](#types-of-meetings)
- Consider if the meeting might have an alternative (is the meeting really needed or could it be replaced by an alternative)
- Prepare agenda (need by invited attendees to know if they need to attend)
- Prepare content
- In case of [physical meeting](#face-to-face-facilitation) Decide on the venue / location
- In case of [virtual or online](#virtual-facilitation) facilitation, decide which tools to be used (and inform in the agenda)
- Consider the physical frame like address, location and surroundings
- Do shorter Meetings, do meetings less Often

A ground rule is that 80% of meetings should be no more than 15 minutes long, meetings har a tendency to take the allocated time (rarely less)

## Facilitation types

### Face-to-face facilitation

**The benefits of face-to-face facilitation include:**
- Relationship building
- Shared context
- Access to nonverbal cues like expressions and body language
- Increased effectiveness and engagement (compared to asynchronous communication)

**The downsides of face-to-face facilitation include:**

- Limited length of interaction
- Deeper knowledge sharing siloed to small groups
- Travel time and costs
- Disruptive in nature
- Manual post-workshop documentation
- Limited number of attendees

## Virtual facilitation

**The benefits of virtual facilitation include:**

- Cost savings – no money spent on travel
- No need to worry about meeting logistics (like booking a big meeting room or organizing refreshments

**The disadvantages of virtual facilitation include:**
- Limited access to facial expressions and other nonverbal cues (especially without a video connection)
- Lack of context 
- Limited relationship-building opportunities
- Limited opportunities for one-to-one communication
- Limited number of attendees
- Poses technical requirements: high speed internet and a virtual meeting too

### Digital facilitaion (async online meetings)

**The benefits of digital facilitation include:**
- Increased flexibility
- Unlimited number of participants
- Enables asynchronous and synchronous multi-way communication
- Extended length of interaction and the ability to collaborate not only during but also before, after, and in between workshops
- Opportunity to combine different approaches 
- Reduced need for post-workshop documentation
- Supports different kinds of personalities, learning styles, and communication styles

**The downsides of digital facilitation include:**
- The facilitator must be willing and able to learn and adjust
