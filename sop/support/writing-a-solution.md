# Writing a Solution

Solutions are actionable user guides. They details how to perform a certain action. However, they should provide enough context to make the customer understand why the steps are being made. They are not aimed to be a detailed, thorough documentation of the system, as this kind of documentation quickly becomes inaccurate as the system changes.

A good template to follow is:

```
Title: Configuring/Acecssing/Setting up X

Short introduction of when this guide is applicable and if there are any other auxiliiary information that would be useful for the user to understand.

1. A numbered list of steps
   With details and screenshots as necessary.
