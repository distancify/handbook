# Create Release Board Item

Releases are tracked on the "Release" board in Azure DevOps.

## When to Create

The naming and timing of releases differs between *SaaS* and *Shipped Software* projects.

### SaaS Project

At the beginning of a new sprint (with planned work), we create a *work item* to track all changes going into the release.

The naming of a SaaS release should match the name of the sprint, for example "J55" for Jedi sprint 55.

### Shipped Software

For shipped software, we create a new Release item when there is a new feature or bugfix about to the merged into an upcoming release.

The naming of Shipped Software releases follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Consult a related Developer for understanding the nature of the release.
